# tests/test_routes.py
#
# This file is intended for writing tests for your application's routes.
# You can use pytest or unittest to define test cases that ensure your routes work as expected.
#
# Usage:
#   - Import your FastAPI app and use the TestClient to make requests to your routes.
#   - Write test functions that assert the correct behavior and responses.
#
# Example with pytest:
#   from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
#   from core.router import app
#
#   client = TestClient(app)
#
#   def test_home_route():
#       response = client.get("/")
#       assert response.status_code == 200
#       assert "Hello" in response.text
#
