# core/security.py
#
# This file is intended for implementing security features for your application.
# You can add authentication, authorization, password hashing, token management, and other security-related logic here.
#
# Usage:
#   - Define functions or classes for security mechanisms (e.g., JWT handling, OAuth, password hashing).
#   - Import and use these utilities in your routes, controllers, or middleware as needed.
#
# Example:
#   from passlib.context import CryptContext
#   pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
#   def verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password):
#       return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
