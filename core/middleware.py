# core/middleware.py
#
# This file is intended for defining custom middleware for your application.
# Middleware can be used to process requests and responses globally, such as for logging, authentication, CORS, etc.
#
# Usage:
#   - Define functions or classes here that implement middleware logic.
#   - Register your middleware with the FastAPI app in your main application file.
#
# Example:
#   from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
#   class CustomMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
#       async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
#           # Custom logic before request
#           response = await call_next(request)
#           # Custom logic after response
#           return response
#
